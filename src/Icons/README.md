# Hindle Icons

Icons are based on X Bitmap format but changed to fit project requirements.

These icons are originally designed by Iconfont and its contributors, converted by ImageMagick (ref: [link](https://www.silabs.com/community/mcu/32-bit/knowledge-base.entry.html/2014/10/21/converting_imagesto-3DRE) ).
